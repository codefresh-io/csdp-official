All resources are defined using Kustomize components in this folder in the following structure:

_components:
  apps: 
    <runtime application>: For example app-proxy, argo-cd, etc.
      _components: Abstract building blocks of the applcation Kustomization
      _bundles: Composite components (components of components) built from the building blocks defined in _components.
                this allows us to create configuration bundles - for example HA and non HA configurations.
  bootstrap: This is the bootstrap component
