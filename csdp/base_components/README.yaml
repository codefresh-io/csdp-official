All resources are defined using Kustomize components in this folder in the following structure:

base_components:
  apps: 
    <runtime application>: For example app-proxy, argo-cd, etc.
      _components: Abstract building blocks of the applcation Kustomization. Should contain patches and manifests.
                   Try to keep `images` patches in `codefresh-base` kustomization, unless you need one `bundle` to have
                   a different image, then you should override the image inside that specific bundle.
      _bundles: Composite components (components of components) built from the building blocks defined in _components.
                this allows us to create configuration bundles - for example HA and non HA configurations.
                Try to keep resources and patches out of the bundle kustomization, it should contain only the composition
                of components.
  bootstrap: This is the bootstrap component
